the basic things are like installing the djangorestframework and installing the required dependencies
after doing it define the models in models.py of the structure you want to add in the database
after that you have to create a url in your students folder after that you also have to edit the urls.py in the main projects folder
the urls.py in the main folder requires to edit because we that url we are fetching are just in the students app we need to
make sure that they work in the django app that we are creating we also need to import the routers so that it can work seamlessly
after that we will declare the stuff we want in the students/urls.py and will work on the views.py serializers.py 
since the data we are rendering is array we need to serialize and deserialize it so we will edit the serializers.py
and afterwards we will make the necessary changes in the views.py so that it can work easily
this is the basic rough outline to make your API work
